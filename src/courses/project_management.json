This often involves modifying the Project Management plan to completely remove the threat.; The Project Manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk's impact or alter the objective at risk. Examples include extending the schedule, changing the strategy, or reducing the scope. The most extreme avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. Some risks that emerge early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, gathering information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise",
        "subheader2": "Mitigate",
        "body2": "Risk mitigation is a strategy in which the project team takes action to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This involves lowering the probability and/or impact of an adverse risk to within acceptable threshold limits.; Taking early action to minimize the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring is often more effective than attempting to address the damage after the risk has materialized. Examples of mitigation actions include adopting less complex processes, conducting additional tests, or selecting a more reliable supplier.; Mitigation may also involve developing prototypes to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. When it is not possible to reduce the probability, a mitigation response might focus on addressing the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine its severity. For instance, designing redundancy into a system can reduce the impact of a failure of the original component.",

This does not mean disowning the risk by passing it to a later project or another person without their knowledge or agreement. Risk transfer typically involves paying a risk premium to the party assuming the risk.; Transferring liability for risk is particularly effective in managing financial risk exposure. Transfer tools can vary widely and include, but are not limited to, insurance, performance bonds, warranties, and guarantees. Contracts or agreements can be used to transfer liability for specific risks to another party. For example, if a buyer has capabilities that the seller lacks, it may be prudent to contractually transfer some work and its associated risk back to the buyer. In many cases, a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer the risk to the seller.",

This approach is chosen when it is not feasible or cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other manner.; This strategy signifies that the project team has either decided not to alter the Project Management plan to address the risk or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy. Risk acceptance can be either passive or active. Passive acceptance involves no action other than documenting the strategy, allowing the project team to address risks as they occur and periodically review the threat to ensure it does not change significantly. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, which includes allocating time, money, or resources to manage the risks."
